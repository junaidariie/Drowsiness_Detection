# Drowsiness Detection - Streamlit App

This project provides a Streamlit-based web application for detecting driver drowsiness states from an uploaded image using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model.

The model predicts one of four classes:

- **Closed eyes**
- **Open eyes**
- **Yawning**
- **Not yawning**

---

## 🚀 Model Performance

The model achieved the following results during evaluation:

- **Train Accuracy:** 94%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** 96%

These results demonstrate strong generalization and high-quality performance on unseen data.
